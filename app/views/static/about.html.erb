<h1>About AccompList</h1>

<h2>What is AccompList?</h2>
<p>AccompList is an app for people looking to give themselves some credit for what they accomplish each day. </p>
<p>What counts as an accomplishment? That's up to you. If it felt like a victory, add it to your list!</p>

<h2>Who is AccompList for?</h2>
<p>Anyone can use AccompList but I think it will be especially helpful for anyone going through tough times. I got the idea from using my GitHub commit graph as daily motivation to keep working while I was feeling down for a few months.</p>

<p>After years of working in mental health services so I know personal goals can look drastically different for everyone. Things like getting out of bed, going for a walk to relieve anxiety, and making plans with friends when you're tempted to stay in (again) can be a big deal if you're having a tough time.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need a reminder that you're getting stuff done. AccompList is a place to give yourself some cred for those victories!</p>
