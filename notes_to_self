things you did that you'll forget about:
- using sass (mixins, variables, etc.)
- separated style sheets into small files
- lists are children of user. tags also children of user.
- routes overhaul on day three because it was more important to have items embedded in lists than showing user_list_path
- changed :items to :items (table)
- rescue_from ApplicationController for fake ids in url (AR record not found)
- redirect fake paths home (no routes for path provided)
- changed tag relationship to be to items instead of tags because of how i set up the item form. walk before run...
- authentication working for fb. google gave me a hard time (maybe because it's http not https?)


to do:
- update devise to user username # nah
- reorganize helper_methods into helpers
- check how you're deciding which functions go under which controller
- omni auth # done
- copy
- fix tags (not required to create new one)
