things you did that you'll forget about:
- using sass (mixins, variables, etc.)
- separated style sheets into small files
- lists are children of user. tags also children of user.
- routes overhaul on day three because it was more important to have items embedded in lists than showing user_list_path
- changed :items to :items (table)
- rescue_from ApplicationController for fake ids in url (AR record not found)
- redirect fake paths home (no routes for path provided)


to do:
- update devise to user username
- reorganize helper_methods into helpers
- check how you're deciding which functions go under which controller
- omni auth
- copy
